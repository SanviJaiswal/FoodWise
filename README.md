FoodWise

FoodWise is a beginner-friendly web app designed to help users track food, reduce waste, and make healthier choices in a fun and interactive way. Users can add food items with expiration dates, view them in a color-coded list, and see the estimated impact of saved food in terms of weight, cost, and CO₂ emissions.

The app includes two mini-games:

Healthy Food Game: Shows random food emojis, and users guess if each item is healthy or unhealthy, receiving instant feedback and scores.Tap Challenge: Users click a button as fast as possible for five seconds, receiving encouraging feedback and tracking their tap count.FoodWise also provides simple tips for saving food, like planning meals, freezing leftovers, labeling items, using older items first, and a link to find nearby food shelters using Google Maps.
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app features card layouts, hover effects, pulsing backgrounds, simple animations, and a dark mode toggle to keep text readable. JavaScript handles dynamic updates, calculations of days until expiration, scoring for games, and user interactions.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Sanvi Jaiswal, and I’m passionate about learning and creating. I enjoy exploring the world of coding because it allows me to think critically and solve problems in creative ways. There’s always something new to learn, and that’s what makes it exciting for me. I’m constantly improving my skills in Java, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I work on different projects.</p>

        <p>While coding is one of my main interests, I believe in maintaining a healthy balance between my student life and my personal interests. In my free time, I enjoy playing the violin, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, and I also love to draw and paint. Sometimes, I create digital artwork, which allows me to express myself creatively in different ways. These hobbies help me stay grounded and provide a creative outlet when I’m not coding.</p>

        <h2>Why Coding is So Exciting</h2>

        <h3>The Importance of Kindness</h3>
        <p>Kindness is one of the simplest and most powerful actions we can share with others. It doesn't have to be grand gestures—it can be as simple as offering a smile or a helping hand when someone needs it. Small acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone’s day, and in turn, they can help you feel connected to the people around you.</p>
        <p>I had the opportunity to witness a beautiful example of kindness recently. I was walking in the park when I saw a woman drop her groceries. Without hesitation, a stranger rushed over to help her pick them up. This simple act of kindness made me think about how powerful small actions can be. It doesn’t take much to change someone’s day for the better.</p>
        <p>Whether it’s offering a kind word, helping a neighbor, or just listening to someone who needs to talk, kindness can create ripples of positivity that can spread far and wide. Let’s all make an effort to be kind, not just to others, but also to ourselves.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Gratitude content page -->
    <div class="gratitude-content">
        <h3>Gratitude</h3>
        <p>Gratitude is a powerful tool for mental well-being. It encourages us to reflect on the positive aspects of our lives, helping us recognize the small joys that often go unnoticed. I hope to spread kindness one day, just as others have done for me. Every act of kindness counts, and through gratitude, we can inspire others to join in this positive cycle.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Changing the World Through Our Actions content page -->
    <div class="world-action-content">
        <h3>Changing the World Through Our Actions</h3>
        <p>Our actions have the power to influence those around us. Small gestures of kindness, thoughtfulness, and empathy can create ripple effects that lead to big changes in the world. Every positive action, no matter how small, contributes to a better future. If we each take responsibility for our actions and make the world a kinder, more understanding place, we can all create significant change together.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Dreaming Big content page -->
    <div class="dreaming-big-content">
        <h3>Dreaming Big</h3>
        <p>Dreaming big is the first step towards achieving something extraordinary. When we set ambitious goals, we push ourselves beyond what we think is possible. We should always dare to dream big, no matter how far-fetched it may seem. With hard work, dedication, and belief in ourselves, we can turn these dreams into reality.</p>
        <p>Remember, everything that exists today, from technology to art to social movements, began as someone’s big dream. Never underestimate the power of your dreams—they have the potential to change your life and the world.</p>
